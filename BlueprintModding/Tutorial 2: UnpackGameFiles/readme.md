# **Tutorial 2: Unpacking Game Files**

## 1. Prerequisites

UE4 version 4.22.x must be installed to proceed.

Download the Unpacker Batch Executable from the discord.
Find it here: [Unpacker Batch Executable Discord](https://discord.com/channels/741506916051845121/741509297497964637/743251097900023959)

## 2. Files

Start by creating a folder on your Desktop named 'Unpack'.

Place the Unpacker Batch Executable you just downloaded from the discord inside the 'Unpack' folder.

Open the Unpacker Batch Executable in text editor. It should look like the image below.

Replace 'YOUR_NAME' with the correct name of your file path. YOUR_NAME appears twice in the text. Depending on your PC, the file paths might need to be adjusted. Use common sense in this step. Fix the paths if needed.

Save your changes.

## 3. Unpack

Navigate to your DRG games pak directory.

Commonly found at: C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\Deep Rock Galactic\FSD\Content\Paks\

Copy the pak file 'FSD-WindowsNoEditor.pak' and paste it in to the newly created 'Unpack' folder.

DO NOT DELETE THE ORIGINAL PAK FILE!

Now run the Unpacker Batch Executable, a command prompt will appear. This process will take a few minutes, so let it be.

## 4. Complete

You should now have unpacked game files to explore. This step is important when creating our blueprint mods.
